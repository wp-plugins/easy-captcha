Several types of captcha to protect your site in one easy to use plugin.

== Description ==

Easy Captcha is an ideal solution for those who want to try different types of captcha to achieve an optimal site usability and captcha protection ratio. It allows a Wordpress site owner to choose which captcha should be used on a particular page.

Currently the plugin supports 3 types of captcha:

- Hidden captcha, 
- Simple image captcha,
- Google reCaptcha

**Hidden Captcha** is invisible to site visitors and does not assume any specific user actions. It just checks that a visitor behaves like a human. Although it might seem that Hidden Captcha does not fully correspond to the definition of CAPTCHA (found at the end of the FAQ), it still distinguishes a human from a bot based on natural human behavior. Hidden Captcha also allows checking whether a visitor's browser has JavaScript and Cookies enabled. 

**Simple Captcha** works in a traditional manner: it shows an image and requires a user to enter a captcha code. Simple Captcha stores captcha values on the server side using a custom session approach. 

**reCaptcha** is a reliable and powerful captcha service provided by Google for free.  Please visit [reCaptcha site]( http://google.com/recaptcha) for more details

Any type of captcha from above may be added to the following Wordpress site places:

- Comment forms,
- Login page,
- Registration page,
- Password reset page. 

With Easy Captcha you can easily install different types of captcha on each individual page.

= What is CAPTCHA at all? =
From [__Wikipedia.org__](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA):

> A CAPTCHA is a type of challenge-response test used in computing as an attempt to ensure that the response is generated by a human being.  A CAPTCHA is a test which is designed to be difficult for a computer to solve, but easy for a human.   

>The term "CAPTCHA" was coined in 2000 by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas J. Hopper, and John Langford (all of Carnegie Mellon University). CAPTCHA is an acronym based on the word "capture" and standing for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"

>A common type of CAPTCHA requires the user to type letters and/or digits from a distorted image that appears on the screen.  Different types of CAPTCHA can be used to minimize automated posting to blogs, forums and wikis, whether as a result of commercial promotion, or harassment and vandalism.
